Testing
=====================
***This directory contains test script for enhance remove job relate file
Usage :
 		- ./test_script.sh $WIPERDOG_HOME/PATH
Example :
 		- ./test_removejob.sh /home/user/wiperdog-0.2.5-SNAPSHOT  
 		
***Note: 
  The source test need to check data output when job executed and therefore need to wait for wiperdog return data to file.
  Sometime, wiperdog execute too long and testcase will be not pass. So, you can update sleep time more than in source test.
